# NENA NextGen911 Validation Checks
This repository includes sample 1Integrate validation checks against the National Emergency Number Association (NENA) [NG9-1-1 GIS Data Model](https://www.nena.org/page/NG911GISDataModel) created on 06/16/2018.

For instructions on restoring a backup please refer to the following [documentation](https://1spatial.com/documentation/1integrate/v2_5/Topics/Backup_Restore.htm?Highlight=Restore%20Backup%20Rules)

## Repository Structure
This repository folder is broken down by layer idenified within the NENA guidelines.  Each XML file includes all the Validation rules for that layer, including Conditional, Mandatory and Optional Rules, defined in the NENA guidelines. There are also helper DataStore backups that will assist in getting your 1Integrate environment configured.

## TemplateDataStore
The template datastore folder includes a 1Integrate backup of a DataStore that matches the NENA Schema and another DataStore that holds the Valid Value lists (Domain Lists) for Country, State & County names.  Also included are Esri File Geodatabases of the expected NENA Schema and the Valid Values tables.      
The Valid Values datastore will be required to run some of the validation checks.  The NENA schema database, can help organizations migrate their data into that schema.
