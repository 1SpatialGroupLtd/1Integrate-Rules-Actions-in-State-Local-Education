# Sample Road Centerline Checks
This repository folder contains some Sample Road Centerline checks by Rule that can be used within 1Integrate.  
These road checks are used by a number of State and County organizations using 1Spatial's 1Integrate software. 
These rules are written against the NENA NextGen911 Standard Schema for Road Centerlines

## [Road Must Not Contain Self Intersecting Segments] (RoadCenterlinesDoNotSelfIntersect.xml)
Tests to see if a simple Road geometry has any self-intersecting segments. The find_self_intersections built-in finds the points at which a line self-intersects. The value returned would be a list of (possibly empty) points where the line self-intersects.

### Rule Syntax
Check for Road objects that find_self_intersections(Road.geometry) equals null.

## [Road Centerline Must Not Be Too Short or NULL](RoadCenterlinesMustNotBeTooShort.xml)
Tests to see if a Road geometry is too short or NULL. For this example, a Road geometry needs to be longer than the data unit of length of 3. This rule uses the built-in function line_length. The line_length built-in function returns the length of a line. If the geometry passed in is a simple point or a simple area, then the length returned will be 0. If it is a complex geometry, the length returned will be the sum of the lengths of each simple line in the complex geometry. Note: This function does not currently fully support 3D geometries. Any 3D geometries will be projected down to 2 dimensions.
### Rule Syntax
Check for Road objects that Road.geometry does not equal null and line_length(Road.geometry) is greater than 3

## [Road Centerline Network Must Be Void of Overshoots and Undershoots](RoadCenterlinesMustNotHaveOverUnderShoots.xml)
Overshoots occur when Roads that should be intersecting at their start or end points go past where they are expected to intersect. Undershoots occur when Roads that should be intersecting at their start or end points come up short of where they are expected to intersect. In this example, a distance less than 5 in data unit length defines an overshoot or undershoot.

### Rule Syntax
Check for Road objects that (if there are no Road objects other for which Road:other.geometry intersects start_of(Road.geometry) and Road:other does not equal Road then there are no Road objects other for which Road:other.geometry is within a distance of 15 of start_of(Road.geometry) and Road:other does not equal Road) and (if there are no Road objects other for which Road:other.geometry intersects end_of(Road.geometry) and Road:other does not equal Road then there are no Road objects other for which Road:other.geometry is within a distance of 15 of end_of(Road.geometry) and Road:other does not equal Road)

## [Roads Must Intersect at Start and End Points](RoadsIntersectAtStartAndEnd.xml)
Tests to see that Roads intersects other Roads at the start and end only, as opposed to anywhere along its geometry. This rule explicitly checks the four scenarios in which Roads may intersect each other: start to start, start to end, end to start, and end to end.
### Rule Syntax
Check for Roads objects that for all Road objects other for which Road:other.geometry intersects Road.geometry check that the start_of or end_of Road:other.geometry intersects the start_of or end_of Road.geometry

## [Roads Must Not Contain Other Roads](RoadCenterlinesDoNotContainOtherRoads.xml)
Linear containment occurs when a Road geometry completely contains another Road geometry.  
![Alt text](img/RoadContainmentExample.PNG?raw=true "Linear Containment Example")

### Rule Syntax
Check for Road objects that for all Road objects other for which Road:other.geometry intersects Road.geometry check that start_of(Road:other.geometry) intersects start_of(Road.geometry) or start_of(Road:other.geometry) intersects end_of(Road.geometry) or end_of(Road:other.geometry) intersects start_of(Road.geometry) or end_of(Road:other.geometry) intersects end_of(Road.geometry)

## [Roads Must Not Overlap Other Roads](RoadsDoNotOverlapOtherRoads.xml)
Overlaps occur when linear start/end points go past one another so a portion of Line A is on top of/underneath a portion of Line B.  This rule checks for those instances while also checking that roads do not self-overlap.  
![Alt text](img/RoadOverlapExample.PNG?raw=true "Overlap Example")

### Rule Syntax
Check for Road objects that there are no Road objects other for which Road:other.geometry overlaps Road.geometry and Road:other does not equal Road  
![Alt text](img/RoadsDoNotOverlap_Rule.png?raw=true "Overlapping Roads Rule Screenshot")

## [Roads Must Have a Name](RoadsMustHaveName.xml)
This rule checks for Roads that have a NULL street name attribute.  


### Rule Syntax
Check for Road objects that Road.St_Name is not equal to NULL.
