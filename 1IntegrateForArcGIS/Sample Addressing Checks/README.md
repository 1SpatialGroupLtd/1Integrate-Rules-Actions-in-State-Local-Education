# Sample Addressing Checks
This repository folder contains some Sample Addressing Checks that can be used with 1Integrate for ArcGIS.
These addressing checks are used by a number of State and County organizations using 1Spatial's 1Integrate for ArcGIS software. 
These rules are written against the NENA NextGen911 Standard Schema for Road Centerlines and Site Structure Address Points.
For instructions on uploading and publishing Rulesets, please refer to the following [documentation](https://1spatial.com/documentation/1integrate-arcgis/v2/Topics/Rules/Free_Rulesets.htm).

### [Sample Addressing Checks](SampleAddressingChecks.rules)
Listed below are descriptions and syntax of each individual rule contained within the sample ruleset.

## Road Centerline Validation Checks

### Road Centerline has no gaps in address range
Checks that there are no gaps in the address range between conecting road centerlines with the same road name.  The address gap should only be 2 addresses.  For example if Centerline A has an address range of 2 to 50 then centerline B must have a from address of 52.
This check only looks at roads that are connected from a start to end relationship.

### Road Centerline has no overlapping addresses
Checks that there are no overlap in the address range between conecting road centerlines with the same road name.  
This check only looks at roads that are connected from a start to end relationship.

### Road Centerline address Parity Switch Check
Checks that if two roads are connected at either the start or the end that both road centerline left address ranges have either even or odd addresses and are not mixed.


## Site Address Point Validation Checks
### Site Address Point has matching street name
Checks that every address point has a road centerline within 200 units (typically feet or meters depending on the coordinate system) that has the same road name.

### Site Address Point has matching full street name
Checks that every address point has a road centerline within 200 units (typically feet or meters depending on the coordinate system) that has the same road name, road type (pre and post), road direction (pre and post), etc.

### Site Address Point is within matching PSAP Boundary
Checks that every address point is within a PSAP Boundary and the PSAP_ID of the address point matches the PSAP_ID of the PSAP that the address point is within.
